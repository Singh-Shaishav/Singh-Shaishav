Through self-study and online courses, I have gained expertise in a range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and SQL. I am also proficient in    using various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, React.js, and jQuery, to create responsive and dynamic web applications. Additionally, my experience in designing and   analyzing complex systems has honed my ability to think critically and logically, which translates well into software development.
